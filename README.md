# SYNOPSIS

in dist.ini

```
    [OurPkgVersion]
```

in your modules

```
    # VERSION
```

# DESCRIPTION

This module was created as an alternative to
[Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PkgVersion](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PkgVersion) and uses some code from that module. This
module is designed to use a the more readable format `our $VERSION =
$version;` as well as not change then number of lines of code in your files,
which will keep your repository more in sync with your CPAN release. It also
allows you slightly more freedom in how you specify your version.

## EXAMPLES

in dist.ini

```
    ...
    version = 0.01;
    [OurPkgVersion]
```

in lib/My/Module.pm

```
    package My::Module;
    # VERSION
    ...
```

output lib/My/Module.pm

```
    package My::Module;
    our $VERSION = '0.01'; # VERSION
    ...
```

please note that whitespace before the comment is significant so

```
    package My::Module;
    BEGIN {
            # VERSION
    }
    ...
```

becomes

```
    package My::Module;
    BEGIN {
            our $VERSION = '0.01'; # VERSION
    }
    ...
```

while

```
    package My::Module;
    BEGIN {
    # VERSION
    }
    ...
```

becomes

```
    package My::Module;
    BEGIN {
    our $VERSION = '0.01'; # VERSION
    }
    ...
```

you can also add additional comments to your comment

```
    ...
    # VERSION: generated by DZP::OurPkgVersion
    ...
```

becomes

```
    ...
    our $VERSION = '0.1.0'; # VERSION: generated by DZP::OurPkgVersion
    ...
```

you can also use perltidy's default static side comments (##)

```
    ...
    ## VERSION
    ...
```

becomes

```
    ...
    our $VERSION = '0.1.0'; ## VERSION
    ...
```

Also note, the package line is not in any way significant, it will insert the
`our $VERSION` line anywhere in the file before `# VERSION` as many times as
you've written `# VERSION` regardless of whether or not inserting it there is
a good idea. OurPkgVersion will not insert a version unless you have `#
VERSION` so it is a bit more work.

If you make a trial release, the comment will be altered to say so:

```
    # VERSION
```

becomes

```
    our $VERSION = '0.01'; # TRIAL VERSION
```

# METHODS

- BUILD

    Provides validations after object creation.

- munge\_files

    Override the default provided by [Dist::Zilla::Role::FileMunger](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla::Role::FileMunger) to limit
    the number of files to search to only be modules and executables.

- munge\_file

    tells which files to munge, see [Dist::Zilla::Role::FileMunger](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla::Role::FileMunger).

- finder

    Override the default [FileFinder](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla::Role::FileFinder) for
    finding files to check and update. The default value is `:InstallModules`
    and `:PerlExecFiles` (when available; otherwise `:ExecFiles`)
    \-- see also [Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ExecDir](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ExecDir), to make sure the script
    files are properly marked as executables for the installer.

# PROPERTIES

- underscore\_eval\_version

    For version numbers that have an underscore in them, add this line
    immediately after the our version assignment:

    ```
        $VERSION = eval $VERSION;
    ```

    This is arguably the correct thing to do, but changes the line numbering
    of the generated Perl module or source, and thus optional.

- semantic\_version

    Setting this property to "true" (1) will set the version of the
    module/distribution to properly use semantic versioning. It will also expect
    that you setup `version` with a v-string, without adding quotes. For example:

    ```
        version = v0.0.1
    ```

    Beware you can't setup both `underscore_eval_version` and `semantic_version`
    since both are mutually exclusive: if you try, your code is going to `die`.

    For more details, check
    [this blog](https://weblog.bulknews.net/how-to-correctly-use-semantic-version-vx-y-z-in-perl-modules-eb08568ab911)
    for more details about using semantic version with Perl.

- skip\_main\_module

    Set to true to ignore the main module in the distribution. This prevents
    a warning when using [Dist::Zilla::Plugin::VersionFromMainModule](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla::Plugin::VersionFromMainModule) to
    obtain the version number instead of the `dist.ini` file.

- overwrite

    When enabled, this option causes any match of the `# VERSION` comment
    to first check for an existing `our $VERSION = ...;` on the same line,
    and if found, overwrite the value in the existing statement. (the comment
    still gets modified for trial releases)

    Currently, the value must be a single Perl token such as a string or number.

- no\_critic

    When `underscore_eval_version` is used the generated code for dev versions
    may not technically be [Perl::Critic](https://metacpan.org/pod/Perl::Critic) compliant due to string eval, but is
    nevertheless pretty safe.  This option will add the appropriate `no critic`
    directive to save you the hassle.
